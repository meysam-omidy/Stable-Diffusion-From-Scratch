## Overview

This repository contains an implementation of a diffusion model for generating MNIST images. Diffusion models have gained popularity for their ability to generate high-quality images through a process of iterative refinement. This project demonstrates how such a model can be applied to the MNIST dataset for generating handwritten digits.
